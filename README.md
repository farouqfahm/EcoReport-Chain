**Project Description**
EcoReport is a mobile-first environmental incident reporting platform that enables citizens to document issues like pollution, flooding, and deforestation. Reports are pre-screened with AI, verified by trusted community validators, and rewarded with blockchain-based EcoTokens. The system gamifies climate monitoring to build a real-time community-driven environmental intelligence network.

**Tools & Technologies Used**

* Frontend: Next.js 15 (mobile-first, server-side rendering)
* Backend/Data: Firebase Firestore
* AI Services: Hugging Face image models, Afriberta multilingual NLP
* Blockchain: Cardano testnet via Cardano Wallet APIs
* Communications: Africaâ€™s Talking for USSD & SMS

**Cardano / Web3 Integration**

* EcoTokens are minted on the Cardano blockchain as reward tokens
* Smart contract logic issues:

  * 50 tokens for each AI and community-verified report
  * 10 tokens or 5 tokens for validator verdicts
* Token transactions contain metadata (report ID, timestamps) for auditability
* Integrated Cardano wallet inside the app shows token balance, address, and on-chain transaction history
* Testnet deployment enables transparent token distribution with future mainnet scalability
